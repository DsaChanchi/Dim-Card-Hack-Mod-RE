Digimon Vital Bracelet Owner Discovers Nintendo Switch NFC Triggers Battles!


The Digimon Vital Bracelet is all about battling, and the discovery a Digimon Vital Bracelet owner just found is really going to take that to the next limit. The Digimon Vital Bracelet allows users to place your bracelet near any NFC touch point to begin a battle, and the Nintendo Switch features NFC which will do just the trick!

In a YouTube video, the Vital Bracelet owner shows off how you can farm battles from your beloved Nintendo Switch! Simply access system settings on your Switch, then amiibo, select “register owner and nick name” this will enable the NFC touchpoint! The Switch will say that this is not an amiibo, but you can exit that popup window, and place your bracelet near the joystick which is where the NFC touchpoint is located. From there your Digimon Vital Bracelet will show the warning graphic and you’ll begin a battle!

How awesome is that? You can now farm battles right from your Nintendo Switch. This was a very creative way to battle over and over again without leaving your house!
