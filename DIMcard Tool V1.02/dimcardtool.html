<h2 style="text-align: center">DIMcard tool Guide</h2>

<p>Digimon DIMcards contain little flashchips that can be (re)programmed. 
This tool was made for the purpose of customizing dimcards and requires a
CH341A mini programmer to re-program DIMcards.

</p><p>This tools programmer code is based on the AsProgrammer project by nofeletru
<a href="https://github.com/nofeletru/UsbAsp-flash/">https://github.com/nofeletru/UsbAsp-flash/</a>

</p><h3>INSTALLATION</h3>

<p>There is no installer so all you have to do is unpack the zip file to a
location of your choice. 
</p><ul><li>If you want a shortcut on the start screen then right click the 
DimCardTool.exe and choose pin to Start.

</li><li>If you want a shortcut on your desktop to the tool then right click the
DimCardTool.exe, choose 'copy to' and then choose 'Desktop (create shortcut)' to
create a the shortcut on the desktop.
</li></ul>
<p>If this is the first time you use the CH341A mini programmer then the driver
must be installed. The driver can be found in the driver folder.
</p><ul><li>Connect the CH341A mini programmer to your computer and wait a little for
Windows to detect it.
</li><li>Go to Device Manager by pressing <b>Windows key + X</b> and then choose 
<b>Device Manager</b>
</li><li>if a suitable driver was already found by Windows, you will see a 
<b>USB-EPP/I2C... CH341A</b> device under the <b>INTERFACE</b> section.
</li><li> If you cant find the device then look for an <b>unknown device</b> with 
exclamation mark in the list of devices. Right click it and choose update 
driver. In the new window that opens choose 'browse my computer for driver 
software' and browse to the folder where you unpacked the zip file and install
the driver.
</li></ul>
<h3>USING THE TOOL</h3>
<p>To start the tool click the DimCardTool.exe. A window like below will appear.
</p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="./dimcardtool_files/screenshot.png">
</p><p>The tool as 4 options:
</p><ul>
<li>Check DIMcard
<p>
Use this option to check the communication with the CH341A mini programmer
and the DIMcard status. If the programmer is not found then check the USB 
connection and/or (re)install the driver. If the DIMcard is invalid then 
check it's inserted properly and check the wiring of the micro SD card module.
  
</p></li><li>Unlock DIMcard
<p>
Once a DIMcard is used on a Vital Bracelet, the DIMcard is linked to that
Vital Bracelet and it can not be used again another Vital Bracelet.
Use this option to remove the Vital Bracelet link so the DIMcard will be
usable on another Vital Bracelet.

</p></li><li>Backup DIMcard
<p>
Before you can customize a DIMcard, you will need to make a backup copy of
the DIMcard. Use this option to save the original DIMcard contents to disk.
</p><p>Note.<br>It is recommended to store a backup copy in a .zip file. So it
doesn't get accidentally patched later on when working on customizing it.

</p></li><li>Restore DIMcard
<p>Use this option to load your customized file or your original copy onto
the DIMcard. The process of erasing and re-programming the DIMcard chip
will take several minutes.
</p></li></ul>

<h3>HARDWARE</h3>
<p>For the hardware you need a CH341A mini programmer, a short micro SD card
module with presoldered header pins and 6 pieces of 10cm long female to female
jumper wires. These can be purchased from on-line shopping sites like
Aliexpress, Ebay and Amazon.
</p><ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=CH341A+programmer">
CH341A mini programmer</a> is often sold with accessories. You do not
need any of those. Only the base unit is required. It doesn't have to come
with software either.
</p></li><li><p><img src="./dimcardtool_files/sd-card-module.jpg" height="165" align="right">
there are many <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=micro+SD-Card+module">
micro SD card modules</a> available. Make sure you get a short version (the 
metal connector, not necessarily the circuit board) and that the pin header
is soldered onto the module already (the pin header is the black bar with 
pins sticking out).

</p></li><li>To connect the micro SD card module to the programmer, 6 <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=10cm+Female+to+female+jumper+wires">
jumper wires</a> are needed. since both the pin headers on the programmer and 
the micro SD card module are male. you'll need Female to Female jumper wires
(Female to Female jumper wires can be identified by having no metal pins 
sticking out of the black ends).
</li></ul>
<p>Note:
</p><ul>
When buying from Aliexpress, the cheaper items and / or free shipping offers
usually takes 2-3 months to arrive but you can upgrade the shipping method to
aliexpress standard shipping to reduce that to 2 - 3 weeks.
(FYI I have no affiliation with aliexpress)
</ul>

</p><h3>WIRING</h3>
<p> The Micro SD card module is connected to the programmer by connecting 6 
female to female jumper wires. The wiring is pretty straight forward. I
recommend to use the same color wires as used here for easy trouble shooting
but you are free to choose your own colors.
</p><ul>
<li>connect black wire from GND to GND
</li><li>connect green wire from MISO to MISO (misspelled MIOS)
</li><li>connect yellow wire from CLK to CLK
</li><li>connect orange wire from MOSI to MOSI
</li><li>connect blue wire from CS to CS
</li><li>connect red wire from 3.3V to 3.3V
</li></ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="./dimcardtool_files/dimcard-reader-wiring-1024.jpg" height="60%">

</p><p> to secure the micro SD card module to the programmer. You can use a cable binder, rubberband, or double sided tape or hot glue.
I chose a non permanent method for now of using cable binder that came with a USB cable and a rubber band.
